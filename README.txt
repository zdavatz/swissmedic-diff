== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Swissmedic does not store old files. You must do this on your own.

Version 0.1.3 is capable of the Packungen.xls without column 'Gruppe',
column E in the previous format. If you want to use Packunge.xls 
including the column 'Gruppe', you should use version 0.1.2. After 
you get the source code via Git command, type in the swissmedic-diff 
directory as follows:

  * git checkout 4c8c9323297453c3cb3380a9d41457d534ed8861

Then you can get the version 0.1.2.
